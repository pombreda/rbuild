.SH NAME
rbuild \- Conary-based Product Development Tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
rbuild
<command> <options>
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
rBuild is the unified interface for Conary, rMake, and rBuilder.
The purpose of this tool is to provide a single, unified, and
fully-documented interface (command line and Python API) to
developers using rPath technologies, using an extensible plugin
framework, which automates many of the steps required to follow
rPath's recommended best practices.
.PP
rBuild depends on product-definition packages that define the
characteristics of the product you are building, including which
images you build, what platform your product is based on, and
so forth. Use the rBuilder interface to create and edit these
packages. rBuild updates them automatically when appropriate.
.PP
A shell script written using the command-line interface should be
relatively easy to transform to a Python program that uses the Python
API.  You can provide your own plugins that dynamically extend that
command-line interface and Python API.  Your plugins can also hook
into other parts of the API, allowing you to enforce preconditions
and take action following successful actions.
