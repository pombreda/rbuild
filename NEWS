Changes in @NEW@:
  o Internal Changes:
    * Various small changes for consistency, primarily documentation
      and removing unused imports and variables, as discovered by
      pylint.

Changes in 0.10:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * The productDefinitionSearchPath macro no longer includes
      flavors, as macros cannot be defined differently between
      different group flavors being built together. (RBLD-134)
    * The "rbuild update" command in a package checkout no longer
      fails with "IndexError: string index out of range". (RBLD-137)
    * The "rbuild update" command will now update group checkouts
      as well as package checkouts. (RBLD-138)

Changes in 0.9:
  o New Features:
    * autoLoadRecipe tags are now read from the platform definition in the 
      product definition and set on the rMake config. (RBLD-95)
    * The build images command can now take an optional list of images to
      build, for example, rbuild build images 'Image 1' 'Image 2' will
      build only those images with exactly matching names. (RBLD-44)
    * The build groups command will now read sourceGroup elements from the
      product definition, and use those source groups as the groups to build.
      (RBLD-110)
    * The productDefinitionSearchPath macro is now set for package and
      group builds so that the ApplianceGroupRecipe superclass can use
      it to set a search path that matches the product definition.
      (RBLD-108)
    * The rbuild status command has been significantly enhanced to give
      more useful output. (RBLD-115)
    * The rbuild build packages, rbuild build groups, and rbuild build
      images commands now warn (with an option to quit) if the product
      definition is no longer up to date. (RBLD-34)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * A product update no longer prints an error message if the product is up
      to date. (RBLD-117)
    * Don't force a run of the initialization sequence for the help or config
      commands. (RBLD-87)
    * Fix traceback that resulted from trying to fetch a product definition
      for a non-existant version. Give an error message specifying valid
      versions. (RBLD-82)
    * When specifying "rbuild checkout <package> --new", don't try to create
      the package if it already exists.  Improve messaging when --new causes
      packages of the same name from upstream sources to be ignored.  Improve
      messaging when --new is used and name conflicts result. (RBLD-30)
    * Errors raised by plugins now are separate from errors raised by
      rBuild internals; the new rbuild.errors.PluginError class is
      available to raise or subclass for plugin-specific error conditions.
    * Tag scripts are no longer run on the binary checkout when checking
      out a derived package. (RBLD-29)

Changes in 0.8:
  o New Features:
    * Added a new --refresh argument to the "rbuild build packages"
      command that refreshes sources of packages being built. (RBLD-61)

  o User Interface Changes:
    * rBuild now prints a helpful error message if it attempts but
      fails to contact the rMake service, and provides other rMake
      errors verbatim, since they are meant to be readable. (RBLD-112)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * Updated the rbuild init help text to note the appropriate usage.
      (RBLD-74)
    * Removed spurious epydoc formatting from various help messages.
      (RBLD-70)
    * Fix tracebacks when asking for help on non-existant subcommands.
      (RBLD-73)

Changes in 0.7:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * The rbuild update stage command has been fixed. (RBLD-89)
    * The file permissions for the ~/.rbuildrc and <project>/.rbuild/rbuildrc
      files are no longer created with world readable permissions. (RBLD-105)

  o Internal Changes:
    * A hidden --lsprof command line argument is now available for
      profiling with the lsprof profiler.  It will write an
      rbuild.lsprof binary profile summary. (RBLD-104)

Changes in 0.6:
  o New Features:
    * The "rbuild build packages" command now accepts a --no-recurse
      option, which will build exactly the packages listed without
      utilizing the group recipe to look for other related packages
      to build. (RBLD-93)
    * Added a "rmakeUser" configuration option for use with multi-node
      rMake.  This will override the defaults taken from "user".
      (RBLD-94)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * The rbuild build images command now can handle multiple images
      built from the same name, version, and flavor group.  Previously,
      only one image of each name, version, flavor combination was
      built. (RBLD-92)

  o API Changes:
    * Requires rMake with rmakeClient.createImageJob() API changes
      defined in RMK-907. (RBLD-92)

  o Internal Changes:
    * Reference loops between the handle and other objects have been
      eliminated by using weakrefs.

Changes in 0.5:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * Creating a derived package with rbuild no longer writes the
      conary state file into the stage directory. (RBLD-86)
    * The rbuild promote command now handles promoteMaps that
      re-root shadows. (RBLD-91)

Changes in 0.4:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * rBuilder passwords are no longer displayed in error messages or
      traceback dumps. (RBLD-66)
    * The rbuildrc file created on "rbuild init" no longer includes
      passwords, and provides informational comments only for options
      other than repositoryMap. (RBLD-77)

  o API Changes:
    * rbuild now uses rMake to communicate to rbuilder. (RBLD-45)

  o Interface Changes:
    * Product information is now stored in a way that allows calling
      code to override the product storage, and the abstract product
      concepts are separate from the implementation of a checkout
      directory.  The Product plugin has been removed, and
      rbuild.productstore has been added. (RBLD-60)
    * Error reports are now stored in .rbuild/tracebacks/ when an error
      occurs while working in a product checkout. (RBLD-78)
    * The "rbuild promote" command now supports secondaryLabel and
      promoteMap in stages. (RBLD-59)

Changes in 0.3:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * "rbuild update" in a stage directory adjusted to use
      getEditedRecipeDicts (RBLD-51)

  o Interface Changes:
    * Top-level checked-out directory now includes the major version

  o API Changes:
    * rMake now searches standard rMake plugin directories for rMake
      plugins when invoked via rBuild.

Changes in 0.2:
  o User Interface Changes:
    * Adds configuration interactively when run for the first time.

  o API Changes:
    * Low-level post hooks have been implemented, and are called
      via the handle.installPrehook() method.  A post hook can
      modify the return value from the hooked function. (RBLD-5)

Changes in 0.1:
  o Initial public release.
