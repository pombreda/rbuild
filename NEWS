Changes in 0.4:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * rBuilder passwords are no longer displayed in error messages or
      traceback dumps. (RBLD-66)
    * The rbuildrc file created on "rbuild init" no longer includes
      passwords, and provides informational comments only for options
      other than repositoryMap. (RBLD-77)
    * Creating a derived package with rbuild no longer writes the
      conary state file into the stage directory. (RBLD-86)

  o API Changes:
    * rbuild now uses rMake to communicate to rbuilder. (RBLD-45)

  o Interface Changes:
    * Product information is now stored in a way that allows calling
      code to override the product storage, and the abstract product
      concepts are separate from the implementation of a checkout
      directory.  The Product plugin has been removed, and
      rbuild.productstore has been added. (RBLD-60)
    * Error reports are now stored in .rbuild/tracebacks/ when an error
      occurs while working in a product checkout. (RBLD-78)
