Changes in @NEW@:
  o New Features:
    * The "rbuild build packages" command now accepts a --no-recurse
      option, which will build exactly the packages listed without
      utilizing the group recipe to look for other related packages
      to build. (RBLD-93)
    * Added a "rmakeUser" configuration option for use with multi-node
      rMake.  This will override the defaults taken from "user".
      (RBLD-94)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * The rbuild build images command now can handle multiple images
      built from the same name, version, and flavor group.  Previously,
      only one image of each name, version, flavor combination was
      built. (RBLD-92)

  o API Changes:
    * Requires rMake with rmakeClient.createImageJob() API changes
      defined in RMK-907. (RBLD-92)

  o Internal Changes:
    * Reference loops between the handle and other objects have been
      eliminated by using weakrefs.

Changes in 0.5:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * Creating a derived package with rbuild no longer writes the
      conary state file into the stage directory. (RBLD-86)
    * The rbuild promote command now handles promoteMaps that
      re-root shadows. (RBLD-91)

Changes in 0.4:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * rBuilder passwords are no longer displayed in error messages or
      traceback dumps. (RBLD-66)
    * The rbuildrc file created on "rbuild init" no longer includes
      passwords, and provides informational comments only for options
      other than repositoryMap. (RBLD-77)

  o API Changes:
    * rbuild now uses rMake to communicate to rbuilder. (RBLD-45)

  o Interface Changes:
    * Product information is now stored in a way that allows calling
      code to override the product storage, and the abstract product
      concepts are separate from the implementation of a checkout
      directory.  The Product plugin has been removed, and
      rbuild.productstore has been added. (RBLD-60)
    * Error reports are now stored in .rbuild/tracebacks/ when an error
      occurs while working in a product checkout. (RBLD-78)
    * The "rbuild promote" command now supports secondaryLabel and
      promoteMap in stages. (RBLD-59)

Changes in 0.3:
  o Bug Fixes:
    * "rbuild update" in a stage directory adjusted to use
      getEditedRecipeDicts (RBLD-51)

  o API Changes:
    * rMake now searches standard rMake plugin directories for rMake
      plugins when invoked via rBuild.

Changes in 0.2:
  o User Interface Changes:
    * Adds configuration interactively when run for the first time.

  o API Changes:
    * Low-level post hooks have been implemented, and are called
      via the handle.installPrehook() method.  A post hook can
      modify the return value from the hooked function. (RBLD-5)

Changes in 0.1:
  o Initial public release.
